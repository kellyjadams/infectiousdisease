# Portfolio Projects
You can view my explanations of my portfolio projects on my [portfolio page](https://www.kellyjadams.com/portfolio) on my website. 

## Python Projects
A set of projects I did for the [2022 Complete Python Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/). 

### Milestone Project 1
My first project was to create a functioning tic tac toe game. It takes in two player's inputs by letting them choose either "x" or "O" for their markers. Players take turns choosing a position on the board for their markers. It also has the option (depending on if the game is a win or a tie) to replay the game. 

## Google Capstone Project
- **Google_Capstone_Project.R** - analyzed the data set from case study 1 in the Google Data Analytics Course using R. I did not do any data visualization in R. 
- **Google_Capstone_Project_T.R** - used code to create a specific data frame to use in Tableau. Deleted unncessary columns to make the code run quicker in Tableau. 
- **Article** - wrote an article summarizing my findings you can read it [here](https://www.kellyjadams.com/post/google-capstone-project).
- **Tableau Dashboard** - created a dashboard in Tableau summarizing the data, you can view it [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/GoogleCapstoneProjectCyclistic/Dashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

## Infectious Disease Model
I created an infectious disease model, **infectiousDiseaseModel.R** based on a common dog illness, Kennel Cough using an R package called "EpiModel". See my full report [here](https://5f31689b-f95d-484d-94c8-97a7bb2f3e60.filesusr.com/ugd/bc9ec1_ed23defb9f41424ab7aee99c35725433.pdf).
