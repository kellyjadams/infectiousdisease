# Portfolio Projects
These are older projects I have worked on in the past. They are smaller projects that only required one file. For larger projects that had different versions or included several files they have their own repository.

## Tic Tac Toe (Milestone Project 1)

My first project for the [2022 Complete Python Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) course, [**Tic Tac Toe Game**](https://github.com/kellyjadams/portfolioProjects/blob/main/tictactoe.py) was to create a functioning tic tac toe game. It takes in two player's inputs by letting them choose either "x" or "O" for their markers. Players take turns choosing a position on the board for their markers. It also has the option (depending on if the game is a win or a tie) to replay the game. You can view my article on it [here](https://www.kellyjadams.com/post/python-project-tic-tac-toe). 

## Google Capstone Project

**This has been moved to my [Google Capstone Project Repository](https://github.com/kellyjadams/GoogleCapstoneProject). The code in both the new repository and the ones that were here are the same.**
- **Google_Capstone_Project.R** is now **[FinalAnalysis.R](https://github.com/kellyjadams/GoogleCapstoneProject/blob/main/FinalAnalysis.R)** - analyzed the data set from case study 1 in the Google Data Analytics Course using R. I did not do any data visualization in R.
- **Google_Capstone_Project_T.R** is now **[FinalAnalysisTableau.R](https://github.com/kellyjadams/GoogleCapstoneProject/blob/main/FinalAnalysisTableau.R)** - used code to create a specific data frame to use in Tableau. Deleted unncessary columns to make the code run quicker in Tableau. 
- [**Article**](https://www.kellyjadams.com/post/google-capstone-project) - wrote an article summarizing my findings.
- [**Tableau Dashboard**](https://public.tableau.com/views/GoogleCapstoneProjectCyclistic/Dashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) - created a dashboard in Tableau summarizing the data.

## Infectious Disease Model

I created an infectious disease model, [**infectiousDiseaseModel.R**](https://github.com/kellyjadams/portfolioProjects/blob/main/infectiousDieaseModel.R) based on a common dog illness, Kennel Cough using an R package called "EpiModel". See my full report [here](https://5f31689b-f95d-484d-94c8-97a7bb2f3e60.filesusr.com/ugd/bc9ec1_ed23defb9f41424ab7aee99c35725433.pdf).
