# Portfolio Projects
You can view my explanations of my portfolio projects on my [portfolio page](https://www.kellyjadams.com/portfolio) on my website. 

## Python Projects
A set of projects I did for the [2022 Complete Python Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/). 

### Tic Tac Toe (Milestone Project 1)
My first project, [**Tic Tac Toe Game**](https://github.com/kellyjadams/portfolioProjects/blob/main/tictactoe.py) was to create a functioning tic tac toe game. It takes in two player's inputs by letting them choose either "x" or "O" for their markers. Players take turns choosing a position on the board for their markers. It also has the option (depending on if the game is a win or a tie) to replay the game. You can view my article on it [here](https://www.kellyjadams.com/post/python-project-tic-tac-toe). 

### Capstone Project (Restaurant Picker) 
My capstone project, [**Restaurant Picker**](https://github.com/kellyjadams/portfolioProjects/blob/main/restaurantpicker.py) was to create a program to solve a problem. This is a simple program I made for a frequent problem my friends and I encounter.It takes my friends and I a while to choose any restaurant. To test my Python programming skills, I created a program that randomly chooses a restuarant based on a few criteria.

The user will be able to choose two things:
1. How much you want to spend: cheap, not bad, or expensive (this is all relevant to me and my own budget);
2. The type of cuisine (i.e. American, Mexican, Japanese, etc.) you want based on the list that's avaiable.

With these parameters the program randomly picks a resturant.

## Google Capstone Project
**This has been moved to my [Google Capstone Project Repository](https://github.com/kellyjadams/GoogleCapstoneProject). The code in both the new repository and this one are the same. I have kept the original files here for version control.**
- [**Google_Capstone_Project.R**](https://github.com/kellyjadams/portfolioProjects/blob/main/Google_Capstone_Project.R) - analyzed the data set from case study 1 in the Google Data Analytics Course using R. I did not do any data visualization in R.
- [**Google_Capstone_Project_T.R**](https://github.com/kellyjadams/portfolioProjects/blob/main/Google_Capstone_Project_T.R) - used code to create a specific data frame to use in Tableau. Deleted unncessary columns to make the code run quicker in Tableau. 
- [**Article**](https://www.kellyjadams.com/post/google-capstone-project) - wrote an article summarizing my findings.
- [**Tableau Dashboard**](https://public.tableau.com/views/GoogleCapstoneProjectCyclistic/Dashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) - created a dashboard in Tableau summarizing the data.

## Infectious Disease Model
I created an infectious disease model, [**infectiousDiseaseModel.R**](https://github.com/kellyjadams/portfolioProjects/blob/main/infectiousDieaseModel.R) based on a common dog illness, Kennel Cough using an R package called "EpiModel". See my full report [here](https://5f31689b-f95d-484d-94c8-97a7bb2f3e60.filesusr.com/ugd/bc9ec1_ed23defb9f41424ab7aee99c35725433.pdf).
