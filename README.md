# Portfolio Projects
These are older projects I have worked on in the past. Originally I had all of my projects in one repo, but since then (around 2022) I create new repos for each project.

## ‚ùå Tic Tac Toe (Milestone Project 1)

My first project for the [2022 Complete Python Bootcamp Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/) course, [**Tic Tac Toe Game**](tictactoe.py) was to create a functioning tic tac toe game. It takes in two player's inputs by letting them choose either "x" or "O" for their markers. Players take turns choosing a position on the board for their markers. It also has the option (depending on if the game is a win or a tie) to replay the game. You can view my article on it [here](https://www.kellyjadams.com/post/python-project-tic-tac-toe). 

## üíä Infectious Disease Model

I created an infectious disease model, [**infectiousDiseaseModel.R**](infectiousDieaseModel.R) based on a common dog illness, Kennel Cough using an R package called "EpiModel". See my full report [here](https://5f31689b-f95d-484d-94c8-97a7bb2f3e60.filesusr.com/ugd/bc9ec1_ed23defb9f41424ab7aee99c35725433.pdf).
